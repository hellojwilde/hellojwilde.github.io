        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <p>
            I'm <strong>Jonathan Wilde</strong>, the photographer/developer
            behind SpeedBreeze.  I  spend my time in school developing skills
            that will hopefully allow me to someday change the world through
            the creative use of design and software development skills.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To achieve this, I continually work to nurture a multitude of
            skills in a wide range of fields.  Whenever possible, I let these
            (often very different) skills collide and intersect (e.g.
            developing software for my stage management work).
        </p>
    
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>
            I've spent the last <strong>eight years</strong> of my life
            learning all sorts of programming languages, including:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Visual Basic (6 & .Net) (2002 - 2006)</li>
            <li>HTML, XHTML, and XML (2003 - today)</li>
            <li>CSS (2004 - today)</li>
            <li>C (2004 - 2007)</li>
            <li>PHP (2005 - today)</li>
            <li>JavaScript (2006 - today)</li>
            <li>Python (2008 - today)</li>
            <li>Java (2009 - today)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Am I a super-amazing developer yet?  <strong>No.  Far from
            it.</strong>  I still have a lot to learn.  I need to build more
            formal computer science experience.  I need to experience many more
            lectures and many more exams.  I still have a long way to go.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Recognition</h2>
        <h3>Google Highly Open Participation Contest - Grand Prize
        Winner, Plone (2007)</h3>
    
        <p>
            During the competition, I wrote extensions for the Plone content
            management system. I developed 4 themes (which give Plone a unique
            look-and-feel) and 2 portlets (which allow website designers to
            place content in the sidebars of their website). I was selected as
            the grand prize winner for Plone because I developed a large
            quantity of high-quality work in a matter of days. The Plone team
            liked extensive web browser testing to ensure that my work was
            robust.
