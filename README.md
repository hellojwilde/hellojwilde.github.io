===============

This repository holds data for my personal website in a
Jekyll-compatible format.

Why?
----

I'm moving away from WordPress/Drupal/(insert SQL-backed CMS here)
because I realized that I'm going to have a wonderfully painful time
trying to migrate my data if I want to move to a different platform or
web host in the future.

I want my site built on a platform that's relatively human-readable and
probably future-proof.  Jekyll makes a good choice for this.  It's
flexible and extensible.  It's based on open formats.  It can be used
with git/GitHub--I can get free revision tracking!
